        <h1>CURS FRONT END</h1>
        <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

       <li>front end</li>
       <li>back end</li>
       <li>design</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.</p>
   <p>This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. </p>
   <p>They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
